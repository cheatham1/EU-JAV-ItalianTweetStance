EU-JAV: Understanding the vaccine stance of Italian tweets

We have finetuned a Transformer-based machine learning model for analysing the vaccine stance of Italian tweets.

Two datasets were collected and the tweets labelled for stance.

dataset A: tweets between November 2019 and June 2020

dataset B: tweets from April to September 2021.

XLM-RoBERTa-large model was finetuned using dataset A and dataset B training sets.

# Here we show how to load the finetuned model and test data, then run the model and plot the resulting stance classifications.
